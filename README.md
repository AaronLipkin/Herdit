# Herdit

### [Link to live site](https://herrdit.herokuapp.com/)

Herdit is a sort of music sharing site, playing off of Reddit. The name is derived from "I Heard It" just like Reddit is "I Read It".  Users can post Youtube videos of their favorite songs and other users can vote to voice their opinion.

My main goal was to keep the user experience really clean and simple.  At one point in the design process I had a ton of colors and bright buttons, but I found that it was fatiguing to look at.  The only color in the site is the liked and disliked arrow notes.
